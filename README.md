Arnis is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into Minecraft. Whether you're looking to replicate your hometown, explore urban environments, or simply build something unique and realistic, Arnis generates your vision.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases/) or [compile](#trophy-open-source) the project on your own.
 
Choose your area using the rectangle tool and select your Minecraft world - then simply click on 'Start Generation'!

> The world will always be generated starting from the Minecraft coordinates 0 0 0 (/tp 0 0 0). This is the top left of your selected area.
Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it! For the best results, use Minecraft version 1.21.4 or above.
If you choose to select an own world, be aware that Arnis will overwrite certain areas.
