Arnis creates complex and accurate Minecraft Java Edition worlds that reflect real-world geography, topography, and architecture.

This free and open source project is designed to handle large-scale geographic data from the real world and generate detailed Minecraft worlds. The algorithm processes geospatial data from OpenStreetMap as well as elevation data to create an accurate Minecraft representation of terrain and architecture.
Generate your hometown, big cities, and natural landscapes with ease!
